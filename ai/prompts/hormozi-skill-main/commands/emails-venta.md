Read the skill file at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/hormozi-marketing/SKILL.md`, then read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/hormozi-marketing/references/sales-copy.md`.

The user wants email sequences for: $ARGUMENTS

Ask the user which type they need:
1. **5-Email Sales Sequence** (for launching/selling directly)
2. **7-Email Nurture Sequence** (post lead magnet, warming up leads)
3. **Both** (complete funnel)

For each email, provide:
- Subject line (max 6 words, curiosity or pain driven)
- Preview text
- Complete body copy following Hormozi frameworks
- CTA
- Recommended send timing (day and time)

Apply all copy rules: specific numbers, short sentences, first/second person, no jargon. Each email must push the reader to the next one or to the offer.
